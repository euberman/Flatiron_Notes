   1. On the project repository, click the green button: "Clone or Download"
   2. Copy the URL provided
   3. In your terminal: `git clone <copied URL>`
   4. `cd` into the project directory
3. Checkout a new branch
   1. `git checkout -b <your-name>`
   2. to verify this worked: run `git branch`

   - If you get stuck, **read the instructions again**
7. When time is called
   1. `git add .`
   2. `git commit -m 'submission for deadline'`
   3. `git push origin <your-name>` - this command *must* be ran while still in the branch `<your-name>`
   4. You will never be able to push to master; you will not be able to push to your own branch before time is called.
8. Make a pull request from YOUR branch to `master`, by visiting the github project repository and clicking the green button: "Submit Pull Request"
